# BetterDiscord-v2
Version 2 of BetterDiscord addons  
(Called version 2 because of Discord UI redesign mid-2025)

---
Update: This repo will generally contain around 2 themes:

- f.theme.css: Primary theme, contains message bubbles, dark/light mode support, changes a lot of things, **more frequently updated**
- OldProfile.theme.css: recreates the old Discord user profile, **less frequently updated**

As I ~~stop procrastinating~~ be more active, I will hopefully separate this repo into "big" themes (above) and "small" themes, which are either links to other mini themes or smaller themes of my own that change less.


```diff
- f.theme.css is VERY broken right now to some Discord update. will remove this when fixed.
+ OldProfile.theme.css is mostly fixed as of right now, however there is an ongoing problem with Notes
```
